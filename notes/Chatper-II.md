#  Chapter II - Degenerate Objects

### TDD Cycle
- Write a test. Think about how you would like the operation in your mind to appear in your code. You're writing a story. Invent the interface you wish you had. Incude all of the elements in the story that you imagine will be necessary to calculate the right answers
- Make it run. Quickly getting that bar to go to green dominates everything else. If a clean, simple solution is obvious, then type it in. If the clean, simple solution is obvious but it will take you a minute, then make a note of it and get back to the main problem, which is getting the bar gree in seconds. 
- Make it right. Now that the system is behaving, put the sinful ways of the recent past behind you. Step back onto the straight and narrow path of software righteousness. Remove the duplication that you have introduced, and get the green quickly.
